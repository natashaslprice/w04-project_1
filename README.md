Description:
	
	Welcome to Coast-to-Coast(C2C).  This app allows for users and visitors to share their experiences on what they consider to be the best or even worst vacations they've had.  Share what city, locations, restaurants, and activities were a part of your experience.  Never visited a city or location that's been mentioned?  Coast-to-Coast helps you gain ideas to make your itinerary for the next best trip.  There's no limit to what you can experience while traveling, so don't limit what you can share with others!

Wishlist / Future Development:

	In the future, I would like to add User Signup and Login.  It was on the many challenges I had while making Coast-to-Coast that I was unable to fully complete.  Expanding from that, I would like to ensure that each user can keep track of the posts they make, and they alone can EDIT or DELETE those trips.  There are several styling features that I would like to incorporate as well.  One such feature includes only showing the form on the '/trip-show' page only when wanting to edit, but otherwise hiding it from view.  Additionally, I would like to include a feature using a maps API which would allow users to spot the locations or cities they post about.  Another good feature would be to be able to find all the trips by city through a search bar.
